Ice Cream Order System

This is a simple web-based system for managing ice cream orders, designed for an ice cream store in Nigeria. The system allows customers to select from a variety of ice cream flavors, with no fixed limit on how many they can order at once. Each flavor corresponds to one scoop, and each scoop is charged at ₦500.

## Features

- **Dynamic Order System**: Customers can enter their name and select multiple ice cream flavors.
- **Price Calculation**: The system automatically calculates the total price based on the number of flavors selected (₦500 per scoop).
- **Order Summary**: After submitting the order, a summary is displayed showing the customer’s name, flavors selected, and the total price.
- **Form Reset**: Once the order is submitted, the form resets to allow new entries.
- **Animated Background**: The page includes a fun animated background with floating bubbles to enhance the user experience.
- **Local Storage (Optional)**: The system saves the last order using local storage, allowing customers to revisit the page and see their previous order.
  
## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and creating the animated bubble background.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the form submission, price calculation, and order summary display.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting the last order details between sessions (optional feature).

## How to Use
